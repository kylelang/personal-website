# Who am I?

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Methodology and Statistics at
Utrecht University (UU). Although I now live and work in the Netherlands, I was
born and raised in the United States. I received my PhD in Quantitative
Psychology from the University of Kansas. I then completed a two-year postdoc at
Texas Tech University (TTU). My postdoc focused on statistical consulting, and
I was able to hone the consulting skills that I began to develop during graduate
school. I also spent a substantial portion of my time at TTU leading the PcAux
Development Team.

My first faculty appointment was as an Assistant Professor in the Department of
Methodology and Statistics at Tilburg University (TiU). At TiU, I taught
statistics and data science courses as part of the Data Science and Society
master program and the Psychological Methods and Data Science bachelor major.

I began my current position at UU in July of 2021. I teach in the Applied Data
Science program and various programs within the Faculty of Social and
Behavioural Sciences.
