I also enjoy (non-outdoor) traveling and taking "city trips" with my wife and
daughter. Such trips are always welcome as they allow me indulge my passion for
trying new foods (or simply eating a bunch of those with which I am already
familiar). When I'm stuck inside and at home, I enjoy weight training, reading
(particularly science fiction and adventure), and chess.
