### Development

Much of my work involves computationally intensive applications of data
processing/analysis, so I spend a lot of my time on statistical computing. As a
natural byproduct of this work, I dabble in software development, particularly R
package development. To find our more, go [here][development].

### Consulting

Beginning as early as the final years of my bachelor studies, statistical
consultancy has been an integral part of my career. In graduate school, I had
the opportunity to work on several interesting projects, and consulting became
the focus of my work during my postdoc. I have continued to provide consulting
services as an assistant professor at Tilburg University and Utrecht
University. To find out more, go [here][consulting].

### Extra Curriculars

To unwind, I prefer to get outside. Even though I've always lived in painfully
flat parts of the world, I particularly enjoy the mountains. When I can get
outside, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, and backpacking/trekking. I developed my
love for nature and the outdoors early. I grew up playing in and around the
woods, lakes, and creeks of the Midwestern US: exploring, climbing trees,
camping, fishing, and making a general mess of myself. When I was a child, our
family vacations would frequently involve either camping in the Ozarks of
southern Missouri or road-tripping to national parks. Now that I live in Europe
and have easy access to iconic mountain ranges like the Alps and the Dolomites,
I am doing my best to live out my life-long dream of adventuring in the
mountains.

I also enjoy (non-outdoor) traveling and taking "city trips" with my wife and
daughter. Such trips are always welcome as they allow me indulge my passion for
trying new foods (or simply eating a bunch of those with which I am already
familiar). When I'm stuck inside and at home, I enjoy weight training, reading
(particularly science fiction and adventure), and chess.
