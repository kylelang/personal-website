### Development

Much of the work I do involves computationally intesive applications of data
processing/anlaysis, so I get to spend a lot of my time on statistical
computing. As a natural biproduct of this work, I dabble a bit in software
development, particularly R package development. To find our more, go

### Consulting

Beginning as early as the final years of my bachelor's program, statistical
consultancy has been an integral part of my career. In graduate school, I had
the opportunity to work on several interesting projects, and consulting became
the focus of my work during my post doc. I have continued to provide consulting
services as an assistant professor under the auspices of Tilburg University and
Utrecht University. To find out more, go [here][consulting].

### Extra Curriculars

To unwind, I prefer to get outside. Even though I've always lived in painfully
flat parts of the world, I particularly enjoy the mountains. When I can get
outside, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, and backpacking/trekking. I developed my
love for nature and the outdoors early. I grew up playing in and around the
woods, lakes, and creeks of the midwestern US: exploring, climbing trees,
camping, fishing, and making a general mess of myself. When I was a child, our
family vacations would frequently involve either camping in the Ozarks of
southern Missouri or road-tripping to national parks. Now that I live in Europe
and have easy access to iconic mountain ranges like the Alps and the Dolomites,
I am doing my best to live out my life-long dream of adventuring in the
mountains.
