I offer professional statistical consulting as part of the Department of
Methodology and Statistics Consultancy program.

I took my first forays into statistical consulting near the end of my bachelor
studies when I had the opportunity to debug and improve some of my supervisor's
structural equation models. During graduate school, I worked for the [University
of Kansas][ku] (KU) Center for Research Methods and Data Analysis (CRMDA). Under
the auspices of the CRMDA, I had the opportunity to work on several interesting
projects including subcontracting to the US Army/Human Terrain System to provide
statistical/data analytic support to Army units deployed in Afghanistan. I
funded the final year of my PhD through very productive consultant/collaborator
positions in the lab groups of Tom McDonald/[Becci Akin][becci] and [Karrie
Shogren][karrie].

After graduate school, I did a postdoc focusing on statistical consulting in the
Institute for Measurement, Methodology, Analysis, and Policy (IMMAP) at [Texas
Tech University][ttu]. During my time at IMMAP, I was involved in several
projects including working with CDC scientists to analyze the data from a large
RCT evaluating the [Dating Matters][dm]&reg; program and leading the development
team for the [PcAux][pcaux] R package.

As an assistant professor---first at [Tilburg University][tiu] and now at
[Utrecht University][uu] (UU)---I have continued my consulting work. I currently
offer statistical consulting to UU students and staff as part of the
[Statistical Consultancy Program][consult] from the [Department of Methodology
and Statistics][ms].

Since graduate school, I have also done freelance statistical consulting on an
independent basis. Due to contractual restrictions, however, all current
consulting work must be officially routed through my role at UU.
