I primarily study methods for missing data treatment. I also collaborate
extensively with substantive researchers.

<!--more-->

My research generally falls into one of two broad categories: methodological
work developing and evaluating methods to treat missing data or collaborations
with substantive researchers from the social-, behavioral-, and health-sciences.

In my methodological work, I mostly explore ways of treating missing data (i.e.,
data with values in the population but unobserved entries in the
sample). Missing values cause myriad problems for statistical modeling,
inference, and prediction, so treating missing data is a crucial step in any
data analysis. Currently, my work focuses on developing and evaluating *multiple
imputation* techniques. In particular, I am interested in ways of simplifying the
process of specifying the underlying imputation models.

In my substantive collaborations, I provide statistical expertise to research
teams from social-, behavioral-, and health-sciences. For example, in [this
project][toyStudy], I helped design a novel planned missing data protocol for
non-survey data; in [this project][kipp], I helped evaluate the efficacy of the
*Kansas Intensive Permanency Project*, and in [this project][sis], I helped
develop norms for the *Supports Intensity Scale*. I particularly enjoy
collaboration because I like contributing to a group effort, and the diversity
of research topics keeps things interesting. As such, I have to agree with John
Tukey's purported quip:

> The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in
  everyoneâ€™s backyard.

I strive to follow open-science principles in my work. So, open-access flavors of
most of my published work are available via the [Utrecht University
Repository][uuRep], my [Google Scholar][gs] profile, or my [ResearchGate][rg]
page.
